# Tab Maker Project
Tab maker allows any musician to learn songs by providing an ergonomic tablature for a given sequence of chords.
With Tab maker you can select from 1 to 4 chords and select a number o different effects to enrich the sound and obtain the one that you like the most.
The algorithm that generates the tablatures is thought to show a 3 to 5 note voicing for every chord that is ergonomically feasible on the guitar fretboard.
After displaying the tabs, the user will be able to play the chord sounds generated either by playing all the notes simultaneously or one at the time (arpeggio).
